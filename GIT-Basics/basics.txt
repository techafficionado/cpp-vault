Interactive rebase off of a point earlier in the history than the commit you need to modify (git rebase -i <earliercommit>). In the list of commits being rebased, change the text from pick to edit next to the hash of the one you want to modify. Then when git prompts you to change the commit, use this:

git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"
For example, if your commit history is A-B-C-D-E-F with F as HEAD, and you want to change the author of C and D, then you would...

Specify git rebase -i B (here is an example of what you will see after executing the git rebase -i B command)
if you need to edit A, use git rebase -i --root
change the lines for both C and D from pick to edit
Once the rebase started, it would first pause at C
You would git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"
Then git rebase --continue
It would pause again at D
Then you would git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>" again
git rebase --continue
The rebase would complete.

To rebase back to the tip of master
git rebase master
